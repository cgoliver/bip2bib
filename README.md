# `bip2bib`: map BIP-39 words to bible verses

Deterministically map each BIP39 seed word to a Bible verse with optional passphrase.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/cgoliver/bip2bib
cd bip2bib
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
python bip2bib.py --help
python bip2bib.py -o out.txt
```

Will generate a text file that looks like:

```
abandon John 13:2
ability Psalms 71:21
able Numbers 18:7
about Job 17:1
above Numbers 13:24
...
youth Joshua 19:8
zebra Numbers 20:20
zero Luke 17:34
zone Psalms 119:21
zoo Esther 15:11
```

To make the mapping unique to you (but still deterministic) you can add your own passphrase:

```
python bip2bib.py -o out.txt -p myword
```

Which generates:


```
abandon Jeremiah 2:14
ability Job 20:3
able 2 Chronicles 26:20
about John 17:17
above Job 24:7
...
youth Mark 1:32
zebra Revelation 9:13
zero John 7:12
zone 1 Corinthians 15:26
zoo Acts 17:17
```

You can always recover this mapping if you remember the seed word you provided.

## How it works

Very simple. We just generate a list of all bible verses in sequential order (saved in `verses.txt`). Each word in the [BIP39 word list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt) is hashed (modulo total number of Bible verses, 32692) with SHA256 to obtain the corresponding index of a Bible verse. If you provide a passphrase, the BIP39 word is hashed together with the passphrase to obtain the corresponding Bible verse.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** For best reproducibility, make sure you are using `verses.txt` provided in this repository. If you are executing within the cloned repo there should be nothing to do. But if the file is not found in the current directory, a routine will execute to generate a list of all bible verses but it cannot be guaranteed to always be identical since it is generated by a third party library.
