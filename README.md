# `bip2bib`: map BIP-39 words to bible verses

Deterministically map each BIP39 seed word to a Bible verse with optional passphrase.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/cgoliver/bip2bib
cd bip2bib
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
python bip2bib.py --help
python bip2bib.py -o out.txt
```

Will generate a text file that looks like:

```
abandon John 4:2
ability Ezekiel 24:10
able Isaiah 36:15
about Luke 6:15
above 1 Samuel 12:13
...
```

To make the mapping unique to you (but still deterministic) you can add your own passphrase:

```
python bip2bib.py -o out.txt -p myword
```

Which generates:


```
abandon Jeremiah 40:5
ability Judges 6:21
able Luke 14:11
about 1 Chronicles 11:4
above Matthew 18:23
...
```

You can always recover this mapping if you remember the seed word you provided.

## How it works

Very simple. We just generate a list of all bible verses in sequential order (saved in `verses.txt`). The index of each word in the [BIP39 word list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt) is hashed with SHA256 to obtain the index of a Bible verse. If you provide a passphrase, the BIP39 word index is hashed together with the passphrase to obtain the corresponding Bible verse.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** For best reproducibility, make sure you are using `verses.txt` provided in this repository. If you are executing within the cloned repo there should be nothing to do. But if the file is not found in the current directory, a routine will execute to generate a list of all bible verses but it cannot be guaranteed to always be identical since it is generated by a third party library.
